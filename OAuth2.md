1. The user click on how he want to being logged in
2. Our server handle the request
3. Our server ask the provider for his permission to access user's account
4. Provider gives his answer through a route we have gave to him
5. Our server handle the previous response
6. If it's ok we can store or use the data retrieved by the provider or even create a cookie
